Hello! I am thunder, a passionate computer engineering student at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), currently exploring the fascinating world of software development, data analysis, and technology-driven projects. This website is built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's designed to showcase my work, projects, research, and interests.

About Me
===

I am currently in my third year of studying Computer Engineering, where I am focused on understanding and applying various concepts like Multi-Level Feedback Queues (MLFQ) for process scheduling and building systems for real-world applications. My journey in software development includes working on a variety of exciting projects, from creating an online tutor management system to designing an autonomous warehouse management system for a roasted duck restaurant.

In addition to my academic work, I have a strong interest in creating interactive and practical tools, like mobile apps and websites, that help people connect and solve real-life problems. I'm particularly drawn to the challenges of integrating complex systems, like using Spark and Hadoop in Big Data processing or building real-time location-tracking apps.

## Key Projects

### 1. **Autonomous Warehouse Management System (AWMS)**  
   This project aims to revolutionize inventory management by automating stock monitoring and ordering processes, ensuring optimal inventory levels in a roasted duck restaurant. The system autonomously places orders with suppliers when stock falls below a predefined threshold.

### 2. **Online and On-Demand Tutor Management System (OOTMIS)**  
   I'm working on an online tutor management system designed for high school students preparing for university entrance exams. The system provides personalized tutoring, helping students hone their skills in preparation for competitions.

### 3. **Big Data Project: Your Voice Matters**  
   As part of a big data initiative, I'm developing a platform that collects student feedback to help improve educational experiences. The project will gather insights from students and analyze the data to generate valuable feedback for institutions.

### 4. **Spy-Man: No Way Home (Board Game)**  
   A project based on historical periods, where players work together to identify a time-traveling spy. Using Greek and Roman civilization settings, this board game blends strategy and history in an engaging way.

### 5. **Real-Time Location Tracking App**  
   I developed a mobile app to help friends track each other's locations and easily meet up in real-time. It features map integration, optimal meeting point suggestions, and party management for smooth meetups.

## Research & Interests

In my academic career, I focus on topics like version control theory and process scheduling algorithms. As part of my research at GitHub University, I am working on the development of new approaches to improve version control systems for large-scale, collaborative environments.

My interest also extends to modern web development technologies such as Tailwind CSS, React, and Jekyll, and I am passionate about leveraging these technologies to build intuitive, user-friendly applications.
